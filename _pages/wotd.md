WOTD is a small experiment in daily fascinations (but not strictly each day). It is an attempt to map the most interesting word of the day - if there is one! - and this way create a catalog over time. The data is aggregated into a small graph, with a long-term goal of finding underlying connections (through e.g. finding the overlap with the connected graph of these topics on wikipedia).
