## WORM
WORM invited me as "physicist in residence" where I'll be restoring and documenting their Arcade Machines. Meanwhile I put the 
physicists' perspective on the magnets, cathode ray tubes, and electronics involved.

## Keywords
CRT, Particle Accelerators, Phosporescence, Metallurgy, Alkali, Mr. Muscle.
